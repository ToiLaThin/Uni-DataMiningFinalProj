# Uni-DataMiningFinalProj
 My final proj in data mining course in university using python. 
 The dataset I used is the same as the one I used in my data ware house final project. 
 Plese visit this repo if you interested in my data warehouse proj:
 https://github.com/ToiLaThin/Data-Warehouse-final-project.git

## Due to size being too big, I cannot upload the main dataset for the project:
 You can download it via this link, keep the same name and put it in the src folder and everything is fine. Or you can explore this by reading the code.
